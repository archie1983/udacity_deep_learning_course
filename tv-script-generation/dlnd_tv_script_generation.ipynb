If I could rotate it that way, then it would be identical to what is expected in the unit test. Unfortunately I couldn't find an easy way in numpy to transform a matrix in such a way. There are only rot90(), fliplr() and flipud() and they are not suitable. Either way though, this doesn't change the training sequences, nor the targets and RNN will still train on perfectly valid batches and sequences, just maybe in a different order and that is why I think that my algorithm is OK."
